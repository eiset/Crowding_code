# Crowding_code
### Code used in analysing crowding as described in the two articles *A generic method for evaluating crowding in the emergency department* and *Crowding in the emergency department in the absence of boarding â€“ a transition regression model to predict departures and waiting time*

This is the repository for my research on emergency department crowding.

The file "RCode_analysis_crowding.R" contains R-code for the data management and analysis described in "A generic methodology for evaluating crowding in the emergency department" https://doi.org/10.1186/s12873-016-0083-4

The file "transition_reg_model_and_plot.R" contains R-code for the transition regression model to predict departures and waiting time as described in https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-019-0710-3

Unfortunately, due to legal restrictions data used for the analysis cannot be provided. A constructed example of the data is provided in "example_data.csv".

I have made an effort to make the code readable and generic. I appreciate any contributions and suggestions to improve of the code.

All code was run in R 3.1.3 on Linux Ubuntu 14.10 systems. Beaware that minor changes may be required after system and package updates etc.

Enjoy
