# Crowding_code
### All the code need for analysing crowding as described in "A generic method for evaluating crowding in the emergency department"

This is the repository for the R code used for data management and analysis in the research project "A generic methodology for evaluating crowding in the emergency department" by myself, Mogens Erlandsen, Anders Brøns Møllekær, Julie Mackenhauer and Hans Kirkegaard. The manuscript has been accepted for publication in BMC emergency medicine.

Unfortunately, due to legal restrictions data used for the analysis cannot be provided, but a constructed example of the data is provided ("example_data.csv").

An effort has been made to make the code readable and generic. Since I am by no means a data scientist or statistician I expect that some code could be more efficient and correctly programmed. I appreciate any contributions and suggestions to improve of the code.

All code is provided and has been tested to run in R 3.1.3 on both OS X 10.10 and 10.6 and Linux Ubuntu 14.10 and 15.04 systems. Beaware that minor changes might be required for running on Windows based systems.

Enjoy
